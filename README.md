### What happens when I run out of Food/Water
Players can survive 10 days without food and 5 days without water.


### Moving to a Water Title
When you move to a water tile you will refill 100% of your water storage. Note water tiles never deplete.

### Moving to a Food Title
Food tiles are limited in quantify, and dissappear when depleted. When you move to a food tile you will refill as much food as you can. Food tiles will randomly appear throughout the game.

### Moving to another player's tile
When 2 players are on the same tile the player with more strength will win and take the other players food.
