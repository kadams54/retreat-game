# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

** Surviving **

Each movement takes 1 day of time. Players eat 1 unit of food and 1 unit of water per day. Players can survive 21 days without food and 127 hours (5 days thanks James Franco) without water.

NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST

* Moving to a Water Title

When you move to a water tile you will refill 100% of your water storage. Note water tiles never deplete. 

* Moving to a Food tile

Food tiles are limited in quantify, and dissappear when depleted. When you move to a food tile you will refill as much food as you can. Food tiles will randomly appear throughout the game.

* Landing on another Player

When 2 players are on the same tile the player who has been around for less days will sacrifice 1/2 of their food and 1/2 of their water to the player whoo has been around for more days.  If the players have been around for the same number of days they will combine their food and water and split it between each other.
